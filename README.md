# Using Twitter for Sentiment Analysis on People’s Attitudes towards Three Major Brands of COVID-19 Vaccines 

## Problem Description

During Covid-19 outbreak, the world has descended into frustration and depression, among other negative emotions[1]. With time, vaccines have been introduced to the world to deal with this pandemic; three of the major brands are: AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. People are encouraged to get vaccinated to reduce the chance of getting infected. However, public attitudes towards these vaccines often change according to recent events associated with a specific brand, which can greatly affect their willingness to get vaccinated. Therefore, understanding how people feel about a certain brand is crucial for coming up with appropriate interventions to improve vaccination rate. A traditional way of gathering data about public attitude is through conducting surveys, but it is time-consuming and has relatively smaller scale. Therefore, the main problem to be addressed is:

How to understand the public attitudes towards three major vaccine brands (AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) more efficiently for the health departments to make effective vaccination plans?


## Project Description 

The goal of this project is to help the health departments take suitable actions and make effective plans to encourage people to get vaccinated by understanding people’s attitudes towards three brands of vaccines (AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna).

This project will utilize social media, speficially Twitter, to gather data about the public’s attitudes towards these brands of vaccines. Twitter is used due to its positive reputation as a great data mine[2], and most of the tweets are public.
